      <p>
        Welcome to BlogsByMayank's Privacy Policy. This document outlines the types
        of personal information we collect, the purposes for which it is used,
        and the measures we take to safeguard your information.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Collected</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect personal information, such as your name and email
        address, when you register for an account or subscribe to our
        newsletter. Additionally, we may collect non-personal information, such
        as IP addresses and browser information, for analytical and statistical
        purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Purpose of Use</h2>
      <p>
        The information collected is used to personalize your experience,
        improve our website, send periodic emails, and administer contests,
        promotions, or surveys. We may also use your information to respond to
        your inquiries and provide customer support.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information
        to outside parties. However, we may share your information with trusted
        third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our
        business, or servicing you, as long as those parties agree to keep this
        information confidential.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to maintain the safety of your
        personal information. However, please be aware that no method of
        transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and
        we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any
        changes will be effective immediately upon posting on this page. It is
        your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically for
